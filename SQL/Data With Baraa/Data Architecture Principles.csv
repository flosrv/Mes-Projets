Principle,Description,Why It Matters,Examples,Tools & Technologies,Python Frameworks & Libraries
Separation of Concerns,"Data architecture should be modular, ensuring clear separation between data storage, processing, governance, and access layers to enhance maintainability and flexibility.","Prevents dependencies between components, improves scalability, and allows independent updates to different parts of the system.","Separating OLTP (operational) and OLAP (analytical) databases, using microservices for data APIs, implementing data lakehouses.","OLTP: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server; OLAP: Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery; Data APIs: GraphQL, REST, gRPC.","Django, Flask, FastAPI"
Data as a Product,"Data should be managed like a product, with clear ownership, well-defined quality metrics, and self-service access for users.","Increases trust in data, improves usability, and prevents data silos.","Data Mesh approach where teams own their datasets, governance frameworks for quality control.","Data Mesh: Starburst, Databricks Unity Catalog; Data Quality: Great Expectations, Monte Carlo.","Great Expectations, Pandas, Evidently"
Scalability,"Data architecture must handle increasing data volume, velocity, and variety efficiently.","Prevents bottlenecks, ensures performance, and supports business growth.","Using cloud-based data warehouses, distributed databases, and horizontal scaling.","Cloud DW: Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery; Distributed DBs: Cassandra, MongoDB; Data Processing: Apache Spark, Flink.","Dask, PySpark, Ray"
Interoperability,Data should be shareable across systems using standard formats and APIs.,"Eliminates silos, ensures system compatibility, and facilitates integrations.","Implementing RESTful APIs, standardizing on JSON/Parquet/Avro formats, using federated queries.","APIs: GraphQL, REST, gRPC; Formats: JSON, Parquet, Avro; Query Engines: Trino, Presto.","FastAPI, Flask, Pandas"
Data Governance & Security,"Establishes policies for privacy, compliance, and access control.","Protects sensitive data, ensures regulatory compliance, and prevents breaches.","Implementing role-based access control (RBAC), data masking, and encryption.","Governance: Collibra, Alation; Security: Apache Ranger, AWS IAM, HashiCorp Vault.","PyCryptodome, VaultAPI, AWS Boto3"
Consistency & Integrity,"Ensures accurate, complete, and reliable data across all systems.","Prevents errors, duplication, and inconsistencies in reporting and analytics.","Using ACID-compliant databases, implementing MDM to remove duplicates.","Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server; MDM: Profisee, Semarchy.","SQLAlchemy, Pandas, PyJanitor"
Event-Driven Architecture,Captures and processes real-time data using event streams.,"Enables real-time analytics, reduces reliance on batch jobs.","Implementing CDC, real-time dashboards, and streaming architectures.","Event Streaming: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub; CDC: Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate.","Kafka-Python, Faust, Confluent-Kafka"
Schema Evolution & Flexibility,Allows changes in data models without breaking existing applications.,Supports agile development and long-term adaptability.,"Using NoSQL for dynamic schemas, schema-on-read for data lakes.","NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra; Schema Management: Avro, Protobuf, dbt.","Pydantic, Marshmallow, PyAvro"
Data Lineage & Observability,"Tracks the origin, transformations, and movement of data.","Improves transparency, debugging, and compliance.","Implementing data catalogs, lineage tracking in ETL pipelines.","Data Catalogs: Apache Atlas, Collibra, Alation; ETL Monitoring: Monte Carlo, DataDog.","OpenLineage, Kedro, Great Expectations"
Automation & Infrastructure as Code (IaC),Manages data infrastructure using automated scripts instead of manual setups.,"Reduces deployment errors, increases consistency, and speeds up scaling.",Deploying databases and pipelines using automated workflows.,"IaC: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation; CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.","Ansible, Fabric, Pulumi"
Domain-Driven Design,Organizes data around business domains instead of technology layers.,"Aligns data architecture with business needs, improves data ownership.","Using decentralized data ownership, self-contained data products.","DDD: Data Mesh, Domain-Oriented Microservices; Tools: Starburst, Databricks.","FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLModel"
Storage & Processing Optimization,Uses the right storage and processing strategy for workload types.,"Optimizes cost, performance, and efficiency of queries.","Columnar storage for analytics, in-memory computing for speed.","Columnar DBs: Snowflake, Redshift; In-Memory: Redis, Apache Ignite.","DuckDB, Polars, PyArrow"
